      Now a bit about myself, My name is James. I am the son of the people who founded and created software toolhouse.
      My plan going forward is to look for work in the cyber security and software fields. The best ways for people to contact me would be via the contact form.
      My current skillset is in Java, React, Html, css, javascript, c and c++ and I am currently learning python. 
      I also know how to use Cisco packet tracer, Omnet++ networking simulators.

    <h1>Welcome to My website</h1>
    <p>What will be here will be most of my projects that I want people to be able to see.</p>
    <p>I will also be discussing things here that i find important</p>
    <p> 
      Now a bit about myself, My name is James. I am the son of the people who founded and created software toolhouse.
      My plan going forward is to look for work in the cyber security and software fields. The best ways for people to contact me would be via the contact form.
      My current skillset is in Java, React, Html, css, javascript, c and c++ and I am currently learning python. 
      I also know how to use Cisco packet tracer, Omnet++ networking simulators.

    <p>What will be here will be most of my projects that I want people to be able to see.</p>

      Now a bit about myself, My name is James. I am the son of the people who founded and created software toolhouse.
      My plan going forward is to look for work in the cyber security and software fields. The best ways for people to contact me would be via the contact form.
      My current skillset is in Java, React, Html, css, javascript, c and c++ and I am currently learning python. 
      I also know how to use Cisco packet tracer and Omnet++ networking simulation software.

      BLOG ENTRY 1:
      
      Beyond technology summer has been a time to disconect from programming and just focus on making progress on 
      my health and wellbeing, I have been spending time with my family and freinds, aswell as doing alot of calesthenics and bodybuilding training. I figured out that
      that is something i am passionate about. but moreso i guess i am passionate about exercise and feeling good. What i want to do is make better software tools for this.
      I see what the industry standard is and i think i can do better. Trainerize for example is a good tool for bulding workouts. But it lacks ease of use from a trainers point of veiw.
      The style and colour scheme is also pretty good. The advantage of this app is the price point. It is very cheap and has alot of features compared to other more cut back tools like 
      Strong or Myfitnesspal. I think i can make a better tool that is more user friendly. I may be able to make a clone of trainerize and just make it better. I think this is a good idea.
      Anyways thats the latest from me!

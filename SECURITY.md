## Supported Versions

Current most up to date is secure as far as i am aware. However i will be looking into changes as software develops to make certain things more secure.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report directly to me on here or leave something in the issues/pull request of the repo that is having the issue.
Thanks
